These are the music files (in FLAC and OGG formats) from the recently open sourced Monster RPG 2. (Except jungle_ambience, which is not original).

The game is licensed under the Give It Your Own License, License, and I've chosen to re-license them under CC0, but I'm sure the good folks at Nooskewl Games would appreciate a shout out if you use their works.
